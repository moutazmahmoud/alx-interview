# Prime Game

This project involves determining the winner of a game between Maria and Ben. They take turns picking prime numbers from a list of consecutive integers starting at 1. The prime and all its multiples are removed after a choice. The player unable to make a move loses the round.

## Requirements

- Python version: 3.4.3 or later
- PEP 8 style compliance
- Runs on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

- `0-prime_game.py`: Implementation of the game logic.
- `main_0.py`: Example driver file to test the function.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python is installed.
3. Run `main_0.py` to test the functionality:
   ```bash
   ./main_0.py
